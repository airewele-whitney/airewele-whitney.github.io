## üß© Background

**As an Irish Nigerian, I‚Äôve always had an interest in diverse cultures, which led to my decision to study international business. This background has shaped my global mindset and grown my appreciation for different perspectives, whether working in international teams or adapting to new environments. My year abroad at Kedge Business School in Marseille, France deepened that perspective even further. That curiosity has continued to grow throughout my academic and professional journey.**

**It was during my 2024 summer internship as a Risk and Fund Services Intern that I understood how important data is in shaping business decisions and ensuring regulatory compliance. Working closely with risk teams and using tools like Excel and Power BI, I saw firsthand how data could be transformed into valuable insights that improve oversight. This sparked a determination in me to learn how to code, and is what drew me to study data analytics. I enjoy using my skills to create visualisations and solve problems.**

**Outside of work and studies, I enjoy volunteering and have taken part in clean-up initiatives like the Calanques project in France. I also love outdoor adventures, creative projects, and anything that lets me learn something new. Whether I‚Äôm embracing my artistic side through art and design, going on walks, doing yoga, or learning a new tool, I‚Äôm always looking for ways to grow and keep my wellness levels up. Cooking and learning new recipes is a newfound hobby of mine. I truly love recreating dishes for others to taste, which is something I realised when living alone in France.**
