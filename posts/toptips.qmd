Studying abroad is an unforgettable experience but living alone in a new country can definitely be challenging at first. During my year in Marseille, France, I learned a lot about adapting to a new environment, building independence, and overcoming unexpected challenges.
Here are my top 5 tips for students preparing to live alone abroad:

## 1. Sort Out Essentials Early â€” Especially Accommodation and Admin
Before arriving, start searching for accommodation as early as possible.
 In my case, starting late made it harder to find a good place  and it added a lot of unnecessary stress. If you can, aim to secure housing close to your university to make commuting easier, especially if you have early classes.
 Also, make setting up your local SIM card, bank account, transport card, and housing insurance a top priority during your first week it will save you so much hassle later.
ðŸ’¡ Tip: Some services require a local phone number â€” get that sorted quickly!

## 2. Get Comfortable with Budgeting, Bills  and Cooking!
Living alone means taking charge of your finances  and your meals.
 Aside from rent, factor in utility bills like electricity, Wi-Fi, and heating if they arenâ€™t included.
 Platforms like Papernest helped me set up my electricity and Wi-Fi accounts when I moved to Marseille services like this can make a big difference in getting settled smoothly.
Cooking for yourself is another essential part of living abroad.
While it can be tempting to rely on takeaways at first, learning to cook simple meals is not only healthier but also saves a lot of money.
Meal prepping on Sundays helped me stay organised for the week and soon it became something I genuinely enjoyed.
ðŸ’¡ Tip: Start with a few easy recipes you like  having a go-to pasta dish, curry, or stir-fry makes weekday life much easier.

## 3. Build a Routine  It Grounds You
Having a routine when youâ€™re living abroad creates a sense of normality and stability.  Whether itâ€™s a weekly trip to the bakery (trust me, in France this became part of my life!) or planning Sunday grocery runs early before shops close, small habits help you feel more grounded.
I also recommend creating a study schedule that fits around your new timetable especially if classes start earlier than youâ€™re used to.
 At Kedge Business School, classes could begin at 8:30am, so adjusting my sleep routine became a must!
ðŸ’¡ Tip: Sundays in many European cities are very quiet  plan ahead for shopping and activities.

## 4. Stay Open to New Experiences, But Prioritise Safety
Exploring a new city is one of the best parts of studying abroad  but staying safe is important too, especially if you're living alone.
 Learn which areas are best avoided after dark and stay informed through local news or apps.
 In Marseille, I learned quickly which arrondissements were safer for students, especially when travelling alone.
Building a local support network like meeting other exchange students made a huge difference for me.
 University groups, associations, and orientation events are great ways to meet people and create friendships.
ðŸ’¡ Tip: Share your location with a trusted friend when exploring somewhere new for the first time.

## 5. Embrace Growth Through the Challenges
Living alone abroad isnâ€™t always glamorous there will be hard days.
 But every moment, from handling admin in a foreign language to fixing small problems in your flat, builds resilience and independence.
Studying abroad taught me how to manage stress, adapt to new routines, and develop the confidence to handle unexpected problems on my own.
 It also gave me space to rediscover hobbies like sketching, to explore new cities, and to learn practical life skills like cooking something I didn't expect to enjoy as much as I did.
ðŸ’¡ Tip: Keep a small journal during your time abroad reflecting on challenges and wins helps you appreciate how much youâ€™re growing.

Living alone abroad is an experience that will test you  but it will also shape you in the best possible ways.
 Every challenge becomes a stepping stone to becoming stronger, more confident, and more adaptable for life after university.
