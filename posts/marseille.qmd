**I had the incredible opportunity to study abroad at Kedge Business School in Marseille, France, as part of my International Business degree at DCU. Looking back, it’s hard to sum up how much I’ve grown personally, academically, and professionally from this experience — but I wanted to share a few reflections as I enter my final year of university.**

## A New Adventure: Living and Studying in France
**Moving to a new country came with challenges I hadn't anticipated — from finding accommodation to adapting to a completely different education system. At Kedge Business School, I adjusted to three-hour-long classes, stricter attendance policies, and a strong emphasis on group work and presentations.**
**Although it was difficult at first, these differences helped me develop stronger communication, time management, and teamwork skills.**
**Living in Marseille meant immersing myself in a new culture. I loved exploring the city’s coastal beauty, local traditions, and vibrant student life. Although simple things — like finding an open shop on Sundays or navigating language barriers — sometimes tested my patience, they also taught me resilience and adaptability.**

## Exploring New Places


**One of the biggest highlights of my year abroad was the opportunity to travel.**

 **Being based in the south of France made it easy to visit nearby towns, coastal villages, and even other countries. I had the chance to explore beautiful places like Morocco and Barcelona — experiences that truly broadened my perspective and allowed me to pursue one of my favourite hobbies: travelling.**

**During my trip to Morocco, I was able to explore a culture completely different from my own. From the vibrant markets to the rich traditions and hospitality, it was an unforgettable experience that opened my eyes to new ways of life and deepened my appreciation for cultural diversity.**

**In Barcelona, I also had the opportunity to tap into my love for art. From visiting famous landmarks like the Sagrada Família to seeing incredible pieces and exploring the city’s vibrant street art scene, it was inspiring to experience so much creativity in one place. These moments reminded me of how much I enjoy art and how travel can reconnect us with our passions.**

## Growth Beyond the Classroom
**My year abroad wasn’t just about academics — it was about personal growth too.**

**- I became more confident stepping outside of my comfort zone.**


**- I strengthened my independence, managing life in a completely new environment.**


**- I broadened my cultural awareness by meeting people from all over the world.**


**Small everyday experiences, like catching the early metro to my 8:30 am classes or trying new activities around Marseille, added up to a big transformation.**

## Looking Ahead: Final Year and Beyond

 **As I now enter my final year at DCU, I feel a real sense of excitement and motivation.**
 **My exchange experience gave me fresh perspective, a stronger work ethic, and a clearer idea of how much I’m capable of. I look forward to building on everything I’ve learned, making the most of my last year in university, and preparing for all the new opportunities to come after graduation.**
