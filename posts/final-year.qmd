It feels surreal to say it but I’ve officially completed my final year at Dublin City University.
 Looking back, this journey has been filled with so many lessons, unexpected challenges, and personal growth moments that I’ll carry with me long after graduation.

## Specialising in Data Analytics: Finding My Path

Choosing to specialise in data analytics wasn’t something I initially planned from the very beginning of university.
 It was through real-world experience  particularly my internship at Impax Asset Management, that I realised how much I enjoyed working with data.
 Getting to apply technical skills, draw insights, and contribute to solving real business problems gave me a sense of purpose that made the decision to specialise feel natural.
The experience showed me that data is not just about numbers it’s about storytelling, decision-making, and finding ways to make systems and strategies better.
 It gave me clarity and excitement about the kind of work I want to continue doing after university.

 
 Final year was by no means easy.
 Unforeseen circumstances made parts of the year more difficult than I ever could have anticipated — moments where balancing coursework, deadlines, and personal life felt overwhelming.
 But despite the tough days, I kept pushing forward, and every challenge became part of a bigger story of resilience.
Final year demanded more discipline, adaptability, and self-belief than any previous year.
 While the pressure was real, it also showed me just how far I’ve come and that I’m capable of more than I sometimes give myself credit for.

## How University Changed Me
Looking back on my entire university journey, one of the things I’m most grateful for is how much it helped me come out of my shell.
 When I first started, I was much quieter and more hesitant to step outside of my comfort zone.
 But through group projects, international experiences, internships, and all the ups and downs in between, I’ve grown into someone who’s more confident, open, and excited about embracing new opportunities.
University wasn’t just about academic learning it was about learning who I am, what matters to me, and how I want to move forward into the next chapter.

## Looking Ahead: Graduation and Beyond
Now, as I look ahead to graduation and life after university, I feel a mixture of excitement, nerves, and optimism.
 While the future still holds plenty of unknowns, I’m proud of how far I’ve come and excited for what’s next whether that’s starting a new role, continuing to grow my skills, or simply learning more about myself along the way.
University was a chapter full of growth, change, and discovery, and I’m grateful for every part of it. Here’s to celebrating the end of one journey and the start of something completely new.
