When I first started university, I wasn’t entirely sure what career path I wanted to take.
Studying International Business gave me a wide view of many different areas  but it wasn’t until I gained real-world experience that my path became clear.

## Discovering My Interest Through Experience
During my summer internship as a Risk and Fund Services Intern, I began working closely with data every day.
 I saw firsthand how businesses rely on data to drive decisions, improve efficiency, and meet regulatory standards.
Transforming raw information into meaningful insights using tools like Excel, Power BI, and SQL became one of the parts of my job that I genuinely enjoyed.
It was during this experience that I realised how powerful well-analysed data can be.  It isn’t just about numbers  it’s about storytelling, supporting strategic thinking, and making complex information understandable for wider teams.
Seeing the direct impact of clear data insights made me excited to explore this area further and so choosing to specialise in Data Analytics felt like a natural step.

## What I Love About Data Analytics
There are a few key reasons why Data Analytics feels like the right fit for me:

**- Problem-Solving:** I enjoy breaking down complex problems and uncovering insights that might not be immediately obvious.


**- Visual Communication:** Creating dashboards and visualisations helps turn raw data into something accessible, understandable, and valuable.


**- Technical Skills Development:** I find it rewarding to continue learning and building technical skills through platforms like Power BI, SQL databases, and Python fundamentals.


**- Real-World Application:** Data is used across every industry. I love that my skills will allow me to work in diverse sectors, solving a wide range of real-world challenges.

## Looking Ahead
As I move into the next stage of my professional journey, I’m excited to continue growing my skills in data analytics. I hope to contribute to organisations by helping them unlock the power of their data — improving decision-making, driving innovation, and creating meaningful impact.

Choosing this path wasn’t something I planned at the start of university, but sometimes the best decisions are the ones shaped by real experiences.
I’m looking forward to seeing where this journey leads.
