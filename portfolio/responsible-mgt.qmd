## Overview
**This group project examines AI bias in recruitment, focusing on ethical challenges and solutions. It analyses Amazon’s biased hiring tool, explores sustainability frameworks, and proposes institutional reforms to ensure fairness.**

## Key Issues
**- AI recruitment tools often replicate societal biases, disadvantaging marginalised groups.**

**- Flawed training data and lack of diversity in development teams exacerbate discrimination.**

**- Cases like Amazon’s gender-biased algorithm highlight systemic risks.**

## Sustainability Frameworks
#### Triple Bottom Line: 
**Balances profit with social/ethical factors (e.g., Google’s gendered job ads prioritising efficiency over equity).**

#### Stakeholder Theory: 
**Emphasises fairness alongside shareholder interests.**

#### SDGs Alignment: 
**AI recruitment must support gender equality (SDG 5) and reduced inequalities (SDG 10).**

## Case Study: Amazon’s Biased AI
#### Issue: 
**Tool trained on male-dominated data penalised female candidates (e.g., résumés with “women’s”).**

#### Root Cause: 
**Biased historical data and homogenous development team.**

#### Outcome: 
**Project scrapped (2018), sparking global debate on ethical AI.**

## Proposed Solutions
#### Regulatory Measures:

**- Mandate annual AI bias audits (e.g., EU AI Act, New York’s laws).**

**- Require transparency in algorithmic decision-making.**

#### Organisational Actions:

**- Diversify training data and development teams.**

**- Integrate human oversight with AI tools.**

#### Institutional Collaboration:

**- Joint research initiatives to address bias.**

## Conclusion
**While implementing audits and reforms is costly, these steps are critical for ethical AI recruitment. Aligning with SDGs ensures long-term equity and trust in AI systems.**
