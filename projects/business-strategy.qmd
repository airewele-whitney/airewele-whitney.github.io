## Overview
This project involved a comprehensive strategic review of Bord Bia, Ireland's food and drink authority, from the perspective of management consultants. The analysis focused on two key strategic initiatives: expansion into the UAE's Halal food market and enhancing sustainability innovations through the Origin Green programme.

## Methodology
We applied several strategic frameworks to analyse Bord Bia's position and develop recommendations:

- PESTLE Analysis for macro-environmental factors

- Porter's Five Forces for industry competition

- SWOT Analysis for organisational capabilities

- Financial modelling for market expansion projections

## Key Findings
- Bord Bia is well-positioned to leverage its sustainability credentials in the premium Halal food sector in the UAE

- 29% of UAE consumers are willing to pay premium prices for quality-assured beef

- Break-even analysis showed decreasing volume requirements (from 6.7 to 4.2 tonnes) over a 5-year period

- Blockchain-enabled traceability can enhance consumer trust in Halal certification

- Alternative protein development aligns with Bord Bia's sustainability leadership

## Strategic Recommendations
Our recommendations followed a four-phase implementation approach:
1. **Establishment**: Partnerships with UAE certification bodies (ESMA, HIA)
2. **Market Penetration**: Premium pricing strategy focusing on sustainability and quality
3. **Marketing**: Digital-first approach targeting HORECA sector
4. **Scaling**: Expansion to Southeast Asian markets following UAE success

## Conclusion
The strategic interventions identified will strengthen Bord Bia's global position, drive long-term growth, and reinforce Ireland's reputation as a leader in sustainable food production.
