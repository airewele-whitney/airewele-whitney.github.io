    "text": "A New Adventure: Living and Studying in France\nMoving to a new country came with challenges I hadn’t anticipated — from finding accommodation to adapting to a completely different education system. At Kedge Business School, I adjusted to three-hour-long classes, stricter attendance policies, and a strong emphasis on group work and presentations. Although it was difficult at first, these differences helped me develop stronger communication, time management, and teamwork skills. Living in Marseille meant immersing myself in a new culture. I loved exploring the city’s coastal beauty, local traditions, and vibrant student life. Although simple things — like finding an open shop on Sundays or navigating language barriers — sometimes tested my patience, they also taught me resilience and adaptability."

    "text": "Exploring New Places\nOne of the biggest highlights of my year abroad was the opportunity to travel.\n\n\n\nThe Calanque, Marseille\n\n\nBeing based in the south of France made it easy to visit nearby towns, coastal villages, and even other countries. I had the chance to explore beautiful places like Morocco and Barcelona — experiences that truly broadened my perspective and allowed me to pursue one of my favourite hobbies: travelling.\n During my trip to Morocco, I was able to explore a culture completely different from my own. From the vibrant markets to the rich traditions and hospitality, it was an unforgettable experience that opened my eyes to new ways of life and deepened my appreciation for cultural diversity.\n\n\n\nSagrada Família\n\n\n In Barcelona, I also had the opportunity to tap into my love for art. From visiting famous landmarks like the Sagrada Família to seeing incredible pieces and exploring the city’s vibrant street art scene, it was inspiring to experience so much creativity in one place. These moments reminded me of how much I enjoy art and how travel can reconnect us with our passions."

My exchange experience gave me fresh perspective, a stronger work ethic, and a clearer idea of how much I’m capable of. I look forward to building on everything I’ve learned, making the most of my last year in university, and preparing for all the new opportunities to come after graduation."

It was through real-world experience particularly my internship at Impax Asset Management, that I realised how much I enjoyed working with data. Getting to apply technical skills, draw insights, and contribute to solving real business problems gave me a sense of purpose that made the decision to specialise feel natural. The experience showed me that data is not just about numbers it’s about storytelling, decision-making, and finding ways to make systems and strategies better. It gave me clarity and excitement about the kind of work I want to continue doing after university.\n## Final Year: A Journey of Highs, Lows, and Growth Final year was by no means easy. Unforeseen circumstances made parts of the year more difficult than I ever could have anticipated — moments where balancing coursework, deadlines, and personal life felt overwhelming. But despite the tough days, I kept pushing forward, and every challenge became part of a bigger story of resilience. Final year demanded more discipline, adaptability, and self-belief than any previous year. While the pressure was real, it also showed me just how far I’ve come and that I’m capable of more than I sometimes give myself credit for."
