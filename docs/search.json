    "text": "1. Sort Out Essentials Early — Especially Accommodation and Admin\nBefore arriving, start searching for accommodation as early as possible. In my case, starting late made it harder to find a good place and it added a lot of unnecessary stress. If you can, aim to secure housing close to your university to make commuting easier, especially if you have early classes. Also, make setting up your local SIM card, bank account, transport card, and housing insurance a top priority during your first week it will save you so much hassle later. 💡 Tip: Some services require a local phone number — get that sorted quickly!"

    "text": "2. Get Comfortable with Budgeting, Bills and Cooking!\nLiving alone means taking charge of your finances and your meals. Aside from rent, factor in utility bills like electricity, Wi-Fi, and heating if they aren’t included. Platforms like Papernest helped me set up my electricity and Wi-Fi accounts when I moved to Marseille services like this can make a big difference in getting settled smoothly. Cooking for yourself is another essential part of living abroad. While it can be tempting to rely on takeaways at first, learning to cook simple meals is not only healthier but also saves a lot of money. Meal prepping on Sundays helped me stay organised for the week and soon it became something I genuinely enjoyed. 💡 Tip: Start with a few easy recipes you like having a go-to pasta dish, curry, or stir-fry makes weekday life much easier."

    "text": "3. Build a Routine It Grounds You\nHaving a routine when you’re living abroad creates a sense of normality and stability. Whether it’s a weekly trip to the bakery (trust me, in France this became part of my life!) or planning Sunday grocery runs early before shops close, small habits help you feel more grounded. I also recommend creating a study schedule that fits around your new timetable especially if classes start earlier than you’re used to. At Kedge Business School, classes could begin at 8:30am, so adjusting my sleep routine became a must! 💡 Tip: Sundays in many European cities are very quiet plan ahead for shopping and activities."

    "text": "4. Stay Open to New Experiences, But Prioritise Safety\nExploring a new city is one of the best parts of studying abroad but staying safe is important too, especially if you’re living alone. Learn which areas are best avoided after dark and stay informed through local news or apps. In Marseille, I learned quickly which arrondissements were safer for students, especially when travelling alone. Building a local support network like meeting other exchange students made a huge difference for me. University groups, associations, and orientation events are great ways to meet people and create friendships. 💡 Tip: Share your location with a trusted friend when exploring somewhere new for the first time."

But every moment, from handling admin in a foreign language to fixing small problems in your flat, builds resilience and independence. Studying abroad taught me how to manage stress, adapt to new routines, and develop the confidence to handle unexpected problems on my own. It also gave me space to rediscover hobbies like sketching, to explore new cities, and to learn practical life skills like cooking something I didn’t expect to enjoy as much as I did. 💡 Tip: Keep a small journal during your time abroad reflecting on challenges and wins helps you appreciate how much you’re growing.\nLiving alone abroad is an experience that will test you but it will also shape you in the best possible ways. Every challenge becomes a stepping stone to becoming stronger, more confident, and more adaptable for life after university."

It was through real-world experience particularly my internship at Impax Asset Management, that I realised how much I enjoyed working with data. Getting to apply technical skills, draw insights, and contribute to solving real business problems gave me a sense of purpose that made the decision to specialise feel natural. The experience showed me that data is not just about numbers it’s about storytelling, decision-making, and finding ways to make systems and strategies better. It gave me clarity and excitement about the kind of work I want to continue doing after university.\n## Final Year: A Journey of Highs, Lows, and Growth Final year was by no means easy. Unforeseen circumstances made parts of the year more difficult than I ever could have anticipated — moments where balancing coursework, deadlines, and personal life felt overwhelming. But despite the tough days, I kept pushing forward, and every challenge became part of a bigger story of resilience. Final year demanded more discipline, adaptability, and self-belief than any previous year. While the pressure was real, it also showed me just how far I’ve come and that I’m capable of more than I sometimes give myself credit for."

Looking back, it’s hard to sum up how much I’ve grown personally, academically, and professionally from this experience — but I wanted to share a few reflections as I enter my final year of university."

    "text": "A New Adventure: Living and Studying in France\nMoving to a new country came with challenges I hadn’t anticipated — from finding accommodation to adapting to a completely different education system. At Kedge Business School, I adjusted to three-hour-long classes, stricter attendance policies, and a strong emphasis on group work and presentations. Although it was difficult at first, these differences helped me develop stronger communication, time management, and teamwork skills. Living in Marseille meant immersing myself in a new culture. I loved exploring the city’s coastal beauty, local traditions, and vibrant student life. Although simple things — like finding an open shop on Sundays or navigating language barriers — sometimes tested my patience, they also taught me resilience and adaptability."

    "text": "Exploring New Places\nOne of the biggest highlights of my year abroad was the opportunity to travel.\n\n\n\nThe Calanque, Marseille\n\n\nBeing based in the south of France made it easy to visit nearby towns, coastal villages, and even other countries. I had the chance to explore beautiful places like Morocco and Barcelona — experiences that truly broadened my perspective and allowed me to pursue one of my favourite hobbies: travelling.\n During my trip to Morocco, I was able to explore a culture completely different from my own. From the vibrant markets to the rich traditions and hospitality, it was an unforgettable experience that opened my eyes to new ways of life and deepened my appreciation for cultural diversity.\n\n\n\nSagrada Família\n\n\n In Barcelona, I also had the opportunity to tap into my love for art. From visiting famous landmarks like the Sagrada Família to seeing incredible pieces and exploring the city’s vibrant street art scene, it was inspiring to experience so much creativity in one place. These moments reminded me of how much I enjoy art and how travel can reconnect us with our passions."

    "text": "Growth Beyond the Classroom\nMy year abroad wasn’t just about academics — it was about personal growth too.\n\nI became more confident stepping outside of my comfort zone.\nI strengthened my independence, managing life in a completely new environment.\nI broadened my cultural awareness by meeting people from all over the world.\n\nSmall everyday experiences, like catching the early metro to my 8:30 am classes or trying new activities around Marseille, added up to a big transformation.\n## Looking Ahead: Final Year and Beyond\nAs I now enter my final year at DCU, I feel a real sense of excitement and motivation. My exchange experience gave me fresh perspective, a stronger work ethic, and a clearer idea of how much I’m capable of. I look forward to building on everything I’ve learned, making the most of my last year in university, and preparing for all the new opportunities to come after graduation."
