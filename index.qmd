#### Short Bio
**I’m a final-year student of international business with French at Dublin City University, with a specialisation in data analytics.

With my background in data, I enjoy using tools like Power BI and Excel to explore information and present it in meaningful visualisations. This site is a reflection of my skills, interests, hobbies, and ongoing journey as I pursue opportunities to continuously learn and apply my skills.**
